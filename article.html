        <h1>Why an Adblock is Important</h1>
        <p style="text-indent: 5em;"> Some of the main reasons behind having a quote on quote adblocker, is to have increased network security.
           as it provides a layer of protection between noisy, malicious, or otherwise unwarranted ads. Which may pose a
           major issue for the enjoyment that can otherwise be had at a website. If there weren't noisy, large (both in
           terms of space, or in terms of file size), or malicious ads, there wouldn't be as much of a necessity for
           adblockers.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 5em;"> Due to the major concerns previously stated, adblockers are necessary, unless of course there is due diligence
           on the part of the advertisers (i.e. Google's ad service, and other ad services), and on the part of the publishers (the website developers),
           if they truly want more ad revenue. Which means no more video ads, period, no malicious ads that can harm the user (who is helping pay the publishers, and google's bills mind you),
           and certainly nothing that can limit the amount of bandwidth that can be dedicated to the actual content of the website. A good example is the picture below:</p>
        <img align = "center" src="images/amazon-logo.jpg" style="width:162px;height:50px;">
        <p> Now that could be the perfect ad, as it is small, and could be placed unintrusively.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 5em;"> Anyways, we can always talk about the future, but for now adblockers are important for internet safety,
           as they can minimize tracking scripts, along with the infestation that is the ad space online today. So if adblock is so great, what is the best adblock?
           Generally u-Block Origin is the best browser side solution for now, and then there is also Pi-Hole, which provides a large assortment of options, and also
           allows you to monitor all internet traffic on your network (hint hint parents). </p>
